# Preface {-}

This book will serve as a source of notes and exercise solutions for *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. My approach will be centered around the `tidyverse`. This is not a replacement for the book, which should be read front to back by all machine learning enthusiasts.

Chapter names will line up, and certain subheadings will also match. Sometimes my notes will contain text lifted straight from the book without modification. This is not an attempt to plagiarize or claim their writing as my own. My goal is for this bookdown project to be a quick stop for machine learning enthusiasts to reference high-level ideas from ISLR in a modern media format.
