# Linear Regression

-----

Linear regression is a simple yet very powerful approach in statistical learning. It is important to have a strong understanding of it before moving on to more complex learning methods.

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is predicting a quantitative response $Y$ based off a single predcitor $X$.

It can be written as below:

<div>
<p style="text-align:center">$Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1X$</p>
<p class="vocab" style="text-align:right">*simple linear regression*</p>
</div>

$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ represent the *intercept* and *slope* terms and are together known as the *coefficients*.
