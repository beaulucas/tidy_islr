## An Overview of Statistical Learning
  
  Statistical learning is focused on supervised and unsupervised modeling and prediction.

## Data Sets Used in Labs and Exercises

All data sets used in this book can be found in `ISLR` and `MASS` packages, with some also being found in the base `R` distribution.

We will utilize the `tidyverse` ecosystem to tackle the exercises and labs, as the `R` code found in the original textbook is outdated. 

```{r required packages}
require(ISLR)
require(MASS)
require(tidyverse)
```
